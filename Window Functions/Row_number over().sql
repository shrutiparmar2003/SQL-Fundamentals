-- WINDOW FUNCTIONS
/* ROW_NUMBER OVER() : A window function in SQL is a type of analytic function that performs a calculation over a set of rows (a "window") that are related to the current row. The key here is that these functions do not change the number of rows in the result set â€” each row retains its identity.

Window functions allow you to perform calculations across rows while still being able to reference the individual rows, which is different from regular aggregation functions like SUM() or COUNT(), which group data and return a single result.*/
