SQL Fundamentals - Personal Practice
This repository contains my personal practice and exploration of SQL concepts. The goal is to strengthen my SQL skills by applying various SQL commands and techniques to real-world scenarios, and ultimately enhance my ability to solve data-related problems effectively.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview
Through this project, I've worked on mastering core SQL concepts and practices such as:

Database and Table Management: Creating, altering, and managing databases and tables.

Data Manipulation: Performing operations like inserting, updating, and deleting data.

Querying Data: Writing SELECT queries to retrieve and manipulate data using conditions, joins, and aggregations.

Advanced SQL Techniques: Experimenting with subqueries, indexes, and optimization techniques for handling complex queries.

These exercises and queries have helped me build a solid foundation in SQL, which I can apply in real-world data analysis or development tasks.

üìÇ Project Structure
01_basics: Basic SQL queries like SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY.

02_joins: Examples of different joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.).

03_aggregate_functions: Working with COUNT, SUM, AVG, and other aggregate functions.

04_subqueries: Practice on nested and correlated subqueries for complex queries.

05_advanced: Includes more advanced topics like indexing, window functions, and query optimization.
