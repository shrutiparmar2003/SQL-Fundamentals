# SQL Fundamentals - Personal Practice

This repository contains my personal practice and exploration of SQL concepts. The goal is to strengthen my SQL skills by applying various SQL commands and techniques to real-world scenarios, and ultimately enhance my ability to solve data-related problems effectively.

## Project Overview

Through this project, I've worked on mastering core SQL concepts and practices such as:

- **Database and Table Management**: Creating, altering, and managing databases and tables.
- **Data Manipulation**: Performing operations like inserting, updating, and deleting data.
- **Querying Data**: Writing SELECT queries to retrieve and manipulate data using conditions, joins, and aggregations.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Experimenting with subqueries, indexes, and optimization techniques for handling complex queries.

These exercises and queries have helped me build a solid foundation in SQL, which I can apply in real-world data analysis or development tasks.
